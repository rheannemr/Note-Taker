# Note-Taker

The note taker application allows the user to organize their thoughts and keep track of their daily tasks with notes. The user creates a Note Title and adds the note information (see photos below for example) and is able to save it. When they either complete their task or the note is no longer needed, they are able to click the trash icon and it will be deleted.
